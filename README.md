## Introduction

Welcome to the Library Management System project! This repository holds the source code for a web-based application designed to help manage the operations of a library, including handling of books and user data management.

## Project Description

The Library Management System is built to facilitate the comprehensive management of a library's resources, including the acquisition, cataloging, lending, and return of books. The system is designed to improve the efficiency of library staff and enhance the user experience for library patrons.
